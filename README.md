Stock Screen: <br /> Identify undervalued stocks in real-time.
</h2>

## ‚ú® Key features

* **Undervalued Stocks:** Identify stocks with strong fundamentals such as low P/E, PEG, and healthy growth metrics.
* **Real-time Data:** Fetch updated stock information from external APIs like Yahoo Finance.
* **Pre Defined Filters:** Screen stocks by criteria such as revenue growth, debt-to-equity ratio, or analyst ratings.
* **Frontend Dashboard:** Modern UI built with React + TypeScript to view results in real time.

## üìñ About the project

This project was created to make stock screening accessible and transparent. Instead of relying solely on third-party platforms, the goal was to build a screener where users can easily identify new investment possibilities.

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, handling data fetching, screening logic, and scheduling background jobs (via APScheduler). The frontend uses **React + Vite + TypeScript** with a clean UI to display stock insights.

A cron job runs periodically to fetch batches of tickers and update their metrics, helping keep recommendations fresh while respecting API rate limits.

## üö´ Limitations

* Free APIs like Finnhub or Yahoo Finance impose **rate limits**, so batch fetching is required.
* Free hosting platforms (Render, Netlify) may spin down instances after inactivity unless external uptime monitors are used.
* Historical data storage is limited without connecting to an external persistent database (Postgres, Supabase, MongoDB).

```

Run the backend:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Update `.env` with the backend URL:
